HardCloud is a research project conducted at the University of Campinas
([IC-UNICAMP](http://ic.unicamp.br/)) in Brazil. It is based on the
open-source LLVM/Clang compiler framework and implements
the OpenMP 4.0 Accelerator Programming Model. Harp2 is a subproject
of [AClang](https://omp2ocl.github.io/aclang/), it is novel and simple
mechanism to offload computation to the FPGAs available in the Intel
HARP2 platform, by extending OpenMP directives in such a way that the
FPGA becomes just another OpenMP acceleration device that can be used
directly from any user program.
